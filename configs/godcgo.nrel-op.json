With the aim to decrease car usage and traffic with sustainable, affordable ways of getting around, goDCgo would like to experiment with an automated (\"passive\") trip tracking solution for understanding travel behavior. This program study can allow goDCgo and its partner NREL to understand mode shifts and transportation patterns without complex, time-consuming surveys.",
        "why_we_collect": "The data collected during goDCgo's ongoing campaigns will be used to understand how sustainable transportation is being used by DC residents, including when and how, as well as distance traveled. It will help goDCgo understand VMT and carbon reductions as a result of recipients' subsituted travel.",
